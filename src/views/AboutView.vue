    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      The University of Texas at San Antonio created the Texas Sustainable Energy Research Institute
      to partner with our community and contribute to a new energy future that builds on a diverse
      resource base to position San Antonio as a significant contributor to the 21st century global
      energy economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Institute integrates scientific discovery, engineering innovation and policy deliberations
      with pragmatic implementation and a commitment to our multicultural traditions to realize the
      promise of tomorrow’s America as a global energy leader. The Institute also serves as a center
      of intellectual creativity that promotes socioeconomic development regionally, nationally and
      globally.
    </p>
    <p>
      We provide systems solutions that pursue novel opportunities for technology insertion to
      reduce costs, improve reliability and assure responsible environmental stewardship that
      contributes to our energy future. Our impact will drive San Antonio’s economic future,
      coalesce our intellectual capital, serve as a magnet for thought leaders from around the globe
      and help secure a foundation for enhanced prosperity for south Texas and the Alamo region for
      decades to come.
